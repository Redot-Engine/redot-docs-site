## Description

A resource to add to an [AnimationNodeBlendTree](class_animationnodeblendtree.md). Blends two animations out of three additively out of three based on the amount value.

This animation node has three inputs:

- The base animation to add to

- A "-add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative

- A "+add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive

If the absolute value of the amount is greater than ``1.0``, the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the amplified animation connected to "-add"/"+add" port.
