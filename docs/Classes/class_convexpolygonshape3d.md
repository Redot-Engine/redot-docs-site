A 3D convex polyhedron shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape3D](class_collisionshape3d.md).

\ **ConvexPolygonShape3D** is *solid*, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike [ConcavePolygonShape3D](class_concavepolygonshape3d.md) which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.

\ **Convex decomposition:** A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several **ConvexPolygonShape3D** nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the [MeshInstance3D](class_meshinstance3d.md) node, go to the **Mesh** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings**. Alternatively, [MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions()](class_meshinstance3d.md#class_MeshInstance3D_method_create_multiple_convex_collisions) can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.

\ **Performance:** **ConvexPolygonShape3D** is faster to check collisions against compared to [ConcavePolygonShape3D](class_concavepolygonshape3d.md), but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as [SphereShape3D](class_sphereshape3d.md) and [BoxShape3D](class_boxshape3d.md). Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
