:::info

This page gives an overview of Godot's renderers, focusing on the differences
between their rendering features. For more technical details on the renderers,
see [doc_internal_rendering_architecture](doc_internal_rendering_architecture).

## Introduction

Godot 4 includes three renderers:

- **Forward+**. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop platforms only.
  Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**,
  or **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses the **RenderingDevice** backend.
- **Mobile**. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile
  and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms. This renderer uses
  **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses
  the **RenderingDevice** backend.
- **Compatibility**, sometimes called **GL Compatibility**. The least advanced
  renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. Used by default on
  the web platform. This renderer uses **OpenGL** as the rendering driver.

### Renderers, rendering drivers, and RenderingDevice

    driver. The Forward+ and Mobile renderers run on RenderingDevice, which can use
    Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal as a rendering driver.

  Godot's rendering abstraction layers.

The *renderer*, or *rendering method*, determines which features are available.
Most of the time, this is the only thing you need to think about. Godot's renderers
are **Forward+**, **Mobile**, and **Compatibility**.

The *rendering driver* tells the GPU what to do, using a graphics API. Godot can
use the **OpenGL**, **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, and **Metal** rendering drivers.
Not every GPU supports every rendering driver, and therefore not every GPU supports
all renderers. Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal are modern, low-level graphics APIs,
and requires newer hardware. OpenGL is an older graphics API that runs on most hardware.

RenderingDevice is a *rendering backend*, an abstraction layer between the renderer
and the rendering driver. It is used by the Forward+ and Mobile renderers, and
these renderers are sometimes called "RenderingDevice-based renderers".

## Choosing a renderer

Choosing a renderer is a complex question, and depends on your hardware and the
which platforms you are developing for. As a starting point:

Choose **Forward+** if:

    - You are developing for desktop.
    - You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal.
    - You are developing a 3D game.
    - You want to use the most advanced rendering features.

Choose **Mobile** if:

    - You are developing for newer mobile devices, desktop XR, or desktop.
    - You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal.
    - You are developing a 3D game.
    - You want to use advanced rendering features, subject to the limitations
      of mobile hardware.

Choose **Compatibility** if:

    - You are developing for older mobile devices, older desktop devices, or
      standalone XR. The Compatibility renderer supports the widest range of hardware.
    - You are developing for web. In this case, Compatibility is the only choice.
    - You have older hardware which does not support Vulkan. In this case,
      Compatibility is the only choice.
    - You are developing a 2D game, or a 3D game which does not need advanced
      rendering features.
    - You want the best performance possible on all devices and don't need advanced
      rendering features.

Keep in mind every game is unique, and this is only a starting point. For example,
you might choose to use the Compatibility renderer even though you have the latest
GPU, so you can support the widest range of hardware. Or you might want to use the
Forward+ renderer for a 2D game, so you can advanced features like compute shaders.

### Switching between renderers

In the editor, you can always switch between renderers by clicking on the renderer
name in the upper-right corner of the editor.

Switching between renderers may require some manual tweaks to your scene, lighting,
and environment, since each renderer is different. In general, switching between
the Mobile and Forward+ renderers will require fewer adjustments than switching
between the Compatibility renderer and the Forward+ or Mobile renderers.

Since Godot 4.4, when using Forward+ or Mobile, if Vulkan is not supported, the
engine will fall back to Direct3D 12 and vice versa. If the attempted fallback
driver is not supported either, the engine will then fall back to Compatibility
when the RenderingDevice backend is not supported. This allows the project to run
anyway, but it may look different than the intended appearance due to the more
limited renderer. This behavior can be disabled in the project settings by unchecking
[Rendering &gt; Rendering Device &gt; Fallback to OpenGL 3](class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3).

## Feature comparison

This is not a complete list of the features of each renderer. If a feature is
not listed here, it is available in all renderers, though it may be much faster
on some renderers. For a list of *all* features in Godot, see [doc_list_of_features](doc_list_of_features). 

Hardware with RenderingDevice support is hardware which can run Vulkan, Direct3D
12, or Metal.
