# LightmapProbe

Represents a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with [LightmapGI](LightmapGI.md).

## Description

**LightmapProbe** represents the position of a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with [LightmapGI](LightmapGI.md). Lightmap probes affect the lighting of [GeometryInstance3D](GeometryInstance3D.md)-derived nodes that have their [GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode](GeometryInstance3D.md#GeometryInstance3D_property_gi_mode) set to [GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DYNAMIC](GeometryInstance3D.md#GeometryInstance3D_constant_GI_MODE_DYNAMIC).

Typically, [LightmapGI](LightmapGI.md) probes are placed automatically by setting [LightmapGI.generate_probes_subdiv](LightmapGI.md#LightmapGI_property_generate_probes_subdiv) to a value other than [LightmapGI.GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED](LightmapGI.md#LightmapGI_constant_GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED). By creating **LightmapProbe** nodes before baking lightmaps, you can add more probes in specific areas for greater detail, or disable automatic generation and rely only on manually placed probes instead.

\ **Note:** **LightmapProbe** nodes that are placed after baking lightmaps are ignored by dynamic objects. You must bake lightmaps again after creating or modifying **LightmapProbe**\\ s for the probes to be effective.
