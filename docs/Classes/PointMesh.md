Mesh with a single point primitive.

## Description

A **PointMesh** is a primitive mesh composed of a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with particle systems, but can also be used as a cheap way to render billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).

In order to be displayed, point meshes must be used with a material that has a point size. The point size can be accessed in a shader with the ``POINT_SIZE`` built-in, or in a [BaseMaterial3D](BaseMaterial3D.md) by setting the [BaseMaterial3D.use_point_size](BaseMaterial3D.md#BaseMaterial3D_property_use_point_size) and [BaseMaterial3D.point_size](BaseMaterial3D.md#BaseMaterial3D_property_point_size) properties.

\ **Note:** When using point meshes, properties that normally affect vertices will be ignored, including [BaseMaterial3D.billboard_mode](BaseMaterial3D.md#BaseMaterial3D_property_billboard_mode), [BaseMaterial3D.grow](BaseMaterial3D.md#BaseMaterial3D_property_grow), and [BaseMaterial3D.cull_mode](BaseMaterial3D.md#BaseMaterial3D_property_cull_mode).
