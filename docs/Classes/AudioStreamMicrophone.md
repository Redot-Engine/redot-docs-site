## Description

When used directly in an [AudioStreamPlayer](AudioStreamPlayer.md) node, **AudioStreamMicrophone** plays back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with [AudioEffectCapture](AudioEffectCapture.md) to process the data or save it.

\ **Note:** [ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input](ProjectSettings.md#ProjectSettings_property_audio/driver/enable_input) must be ``true`` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
