# Xcode

[Xcode ](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) is a free macOS-only IDE. You can
download it from the Mac App Store.

## Importing the project

- From Xcode's main screen create a new project using the **Other &gt; External Build System** template.

- Now choose a name for your project and set the path to scons executable in build tool (to find the path you can type ``where scons`` in a terminal).

- Open the main target from the **Targets** section and select the **Info** tab.

- Fill out the form with the following settings:

  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Arguments  | See [doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem](doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem) for a full list of arguments. |
  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Directory  | A full path to the Godot root folder                                         |
  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Add a Command Line Tool target which will be used for indexing the project by
  choosing **File &gt; New &gt; Target...**.

- Select **macOS &gt; Application &gt; Command Line Tool**.

:::note

- For this target open the **Build Settings** tab and look for **Header Search Paths**.
- Set **Header Search Paths** to the absolute path to the Godot root folder. You need to
  include subdirectories as well. To achieve that, add two two asterisks (``**``) to the
  end of the path, e.g. ``/Users/me/repos/godot-source/**``.

- Add the Godot source to the project by dragging and dropping it into the project file browser.
- Select **Create groups** for the **Added folders** option and check *only*
  your command line indexing target in the **Add to targets** section.

- Xcode will now index the files. This may take a few minutes.
- Once Xcode is done indexing, you should have jump-to-definition,
  autocompletion, and full syntax highlighting.

## Debugging the project

To enable debugging support you need to edit the external build target's build and run schemes.

- Open the scheme editor of the external build target.
- Locate the **Build &gt; Post Actions** section.
- Add a new script run action
- Under **Provide build settings from** select your project. This allows to reference
  the project directory within the script.
- Create a script that will give the binary a name that Xcode can recognize, e.g.:

```shell
ln -f ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot.macos.tools.64 ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot

```

- Build the external build target.

- Open the scheme editor again and select **Run**.

- Set the **Executable** to the file you linked in your post-build action script.
- Check **Debug executable**.
- You can add two arguments on the **Arguments** tab:
  the ``-e`` flag opens the editor instead of the Project Manager, and the ``--path`` argument
  tells the executable to open the specified project (must be provided as an *absolute* path
  to the project root, not the ``project.godot`` file).

To check that everything is working, put a breakpoint in ``platform/macos/godot_main_macos.mm`` and
run the project.

If you run into any issues, ask for help in one of
[Godot's community channels ](https://godotengine.org/community)_.
