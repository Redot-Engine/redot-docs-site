# VehicleBody3D

**Inherits:** [RigidBody3D](class_rigidbody3d.md) **<** [PhysicsBody3D](class_physicsbody3d.md) **<** [CollisionObject3D](class_collisionobject3d.md) **<** [Node3D](class_node3d.md) **<** [Node](class_node.md) **<** [Object](class_object.md)

A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.

<!-- classref-introduction-group -->

## Description

This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. Aside from a [CollisionShape3D](class_collisionshape3d.md) for the main body of the vehicle, you must also add a [VehicleWheel3D](class_vehiclewheel3d.md) node for each wheel. You should also add a [MeshInstance3D](class_meshinstance3d.md) to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the [brake](class_vehiclebody3d.md#class_VehicleBody3D_property_brake), [engine_force](class_vehiclebody3d.md#class_VehicleBody3D_property_engine_force), and [steering](class_vehiclebody3d.md#class_VehicleBody3D_property_steering) properties. The position or orientation of this node shouldn't be changed directly.

\ **Note:** The local forward for this node is [Vector3.MODEL_FRONT](class_vector3.md#class_Vector3_constant_MODEL_FRONT).

\ **Note:** The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point is usually kept low, moving the [CollisionShape3D](class_collisionshape3d.md) and [MeshInstance3D](class_meshinstance3d.md) upwards.

\ **Note:** This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write your own physics integration using [CharacterBody3D](class_characterbody3d.md) or [RigidBody3D](class_rigidbody3d.md).

## Property Descriptions

<a id="class_VehicleBody3D_property_brake"></a>

<!-- classref-property -->

[float](class_float.md) **brake** = `0.0` [🔗](#class_VehicleBody3D_property_brake)

<!-- classref-property-setget -->

- `void` **set_brake**\ (\ value\: [float](class_float.md)\ )
- [float](class_float.md) **get_brake**\ (\ )

Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the [RigidBody3D.mass](class_rigidbody3d.md#class_RigidBody3D_property_mass) of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.

<hr class="classref-item-separator">

<a id="class_VehicleBody3D_property_engine_force"></a>

<!-- classref-property -->

[float](class_float.md) **engine_force** = `0.0` [🔗](#class_VehicleBody3D_property_engine_force)

<!-- classref-property-setget -->

- `void` **set_engine_force**\ (\ value\: [float](class_float.md)\ )
- [float](class_float.md) **get_engine_force**\ (\ )

Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only sped up if the wheels that have [VehicleWheel3D.use_as_traction](class_vehiclewheel3d.md#class_VehicleWheel3D_property_use_as_traction) set to ``true`` and are in contact with a surface. The [RigidBody3D.mass](class_rigidbody3d.md#class_RigidBody3D_property_mass) of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.

\ **Note:** The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.

A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

<hr class="classref-item-separator">

<a id="class_VehicleBody3D_property_steering"></a>

<!-- classref-property -->

[float](class_float.md) **steering** = `0.0` [🔗](#class_VehicleBody3D_property_steering)

<!-- classref-property-setget -->

- `void` **set_steering**\ (\ value\: [float](class_float.md)\ )
- [float](class_float.md) **get_steering**\ (\ )

The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have [VehicleWheel3D.use_as_steering](class_vehiclewheel3d.md#class_VehicleWheel3D_property_use_as_steering) set to ``true`` will automatically be rotated.

\ **Note:** This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. In code the property is set in radians.
