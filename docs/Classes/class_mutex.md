# Mutex

**Inherits:** [RefCounted](class_refcounted.md) **<** [Object](class_object.md)

A binary [Semaphore](class_semaphore.md) for synchronization of multiple [Thread](class_thread.md)\ s.

<!-- classref-introduction-group -->

## Description

A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple [Thread](class_thread.md)\ s, and is equivalent to a binary [Semaphore](class_semaphore.md). It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical section at a time.

This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread, provided it also unlocks it as many times.

\ **Warning:** Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.

\ **Warning:** To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, the following conditions must be met:

- When a **Mutex**'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads (including the one on which the destruction will happen) must have it locked.

- When a [Thread](class_thread.md)'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not have any mutex locked.

## Method Descriptions

<a id="class_Mutex_method_lock"></a>

<!-- classref-method -->

`void` **lock**\ (\ ) [🔗](#class_Mutex_method_lock)

Locks this **Mutex**, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.

\ **Note:** This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

<hr class="classref-item-separator">

<a id="class_Mutex_method_try_lock"></a>

<!-- classref-method -->

[bool](class_bool.md) **try_lock**\ (\ ) [🔗](#class_Mutex_method_try_lock)

Tries locking this **Mutex**, but does not block. Returns ``true`` on success, ``false`` otherwise.

\ **Note:** This function returns ``true`` if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

<hr class="classref-item-separator">

<a id="class_Mutex_method_unlock"></a>

<!-- classref-method -->

`void` **unlock**\ (\ ) [🔗](#class_Mutex_method_unlock)

Unlocks this **Mutex**, leaving it to other threads.

\ **Note:** If a thread called [lock()](class_mutex.md#class_Mutex_method_lock) or [try_lock()](class_mutex.md#class_Mutex_method_try_lock) multiple times while already having ownership of the mutex, it must also call [unlock()](class_mutex.md#class_Mutex_method_unlock) the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly.

\ **Warning:** Calling [unlock()](class_mutex.md#class_Mutex_method_unlock) more times that [lock()](class_mutex.md#class_Mutex_method_lock) on a given thread, thus ending up trying to unlock a non-locked mutex, is wrong and may causes crashes or deadlocks.
